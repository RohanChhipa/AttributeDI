# AttributeDI

This started off as a simple extension to the [DI provided by ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-3.1). The idea was to move away from explicit dependency registrations and towards annotating injectable classes and have them automagically registered to a DI container. The core learnings were meant to be [C# reflection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/reflection) and ASP.NET dependency injection, was eventually extended to CI and CD using GitHub Actions

## Can I use this for my project?
By all means, however, it was meant to be a short project to learn about reflection...so I definitely cut corners ðŸ¤£

It can rather be used for inspiration on how build an attribute-scanning DI library.

## Will this be maintained?
Depends on if I want to learn something new around this. The idea here was to learn about reflection and CI/CD.
